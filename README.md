**Card Battle** is a unique turn-based card game in which a player battles the computer by placing "monster" cards on a 5x5 board. When monsters on opposing teams are placed adjacent to each other, they damage each other according to their attack power. When a player's monster dies, the player's health decreases. When one player reaches 0 health, the game is over and the other player wins. If both players reach 0 health in the same turn, the game ends in a tie.
